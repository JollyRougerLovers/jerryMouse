I have got a bit of problem: The API does not give me telephone number.
I can see the is a phonenumber on http://www.yourlocal.ie/search/ireland/mechanics  in use but there is none in the https://api.centralindex.com/v1/entity/search/what/bylocation?country=ie&what=plumber&where=Dubber,Dublin&api_key=  Ive got.
I also can not search for telephone number. So i made a cheat. 
I had no time to finnish the auto complet things. But already here.
